<h1>Unique WordPress theme</h1>

<p class="first">The Unique theme was created to be a well-designed theme for multi-author blogs that have an enormous amount of content to share in an organized and readable fashion. This guide will show you how to use the theme and point out any special steps you need to take in using it.</p>

<p class="second">This theme is a parent theme.  What this means is that to customize it, you should be creating a child theme.  <em>Is it a theme framework?</em>  Some people might call it that.  All you need to know is that it's a solid, yet flexible, starting point for any blog.</p>

<p>
This theme was built with WordPress standards in mind.  You won't find anything out of the ordinary or be required to jump through crazy hoops just to use your WordPress theme.  Nearly every feature in this theme is a standard part of using WordPress.  So, if you're new to WordPress, the best place to start learning is the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/">Codex</a>.
</p>

<p>
This theme uses the standard WordPress features to allow you to control some aspects of your site's design from within the admin.  The following list of things are located under the "Appearance" menu in the admin and are the things you'll want to set up specifically for the theme.  Note that you'll definitely want to set up your widgets and menus as these are the most important features.  The other features are mostly optional extras.
</p>

<h2 id="child-themes">Child Themes <small>(<a href="#toc">Table of Contents &uarr;</a>)</small></h2>

<p>
	If you plan to make modifications to the code of this theme, you should make them via a child theme.  If you make modifications directly to the Unique parent theme, you will lose those modifications when the theme is updated.  When you make modifications inside of the child theme instead, you can upgrade the Unique parent theme without worry of losing any changes you've made.  This means you can get things like bug fixes and new enhancements in the future.  If you modify Unique directly, you cannot get those updates.
</p>

<p>
	If you're unfamiliar with child themes, the following links will describe them in more detail and provide you with a sample child theme to use.

<h2 id="page-templates-magazine">Magazine Front Page <small>(<a href="#toc">Table of Contents &uarr;</a>)</small></h2>

<p>
Most users will want to use the magazine-style front page for their site instead of the standard blog post view. This is entirely optional, but it's probably what drew you to the theme in the first place.  This will probably be the toughest part about setting up the theme. However, once it's done, you won't have to worry about it anymore.
</p>

<h3>Create the front page</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The first thing you'll want to do is create a new page.  You can name it anything.</li>
	<li>When creating this page, select "Magazine" from the "Template" drop-down inside of the "Attributes" meta box.</li>
	<li>Click the "Publish" button.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Change site front page</h3>

<ul>
	<li>You now need to go to the "Settings > Reading" screen in the admin to adjust the page shown on the front of the site.</li>
	<li>Locate the section labeled "Front page displays".</li>
	<li>Select "A static page".</li>
	<li>In the "Front Page" drop-down, select the page you created earlier that has the "Magazine" template.</li>
	<li>Click the "Save Changes" button.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adding posts to the magazine template</h3>

<p>
This theme is very different from other themes when it comes to its templates.  It doesn't force you to do a lot of configuration to make things work.  It simply works.  The magazine page template loads your blog posts automatically. There are four sections on the page: slider, post excerpts, latest images, and latest galleries.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The slider section will attempt to load your sticky posts if you have any.  If you don't have any, it will load the five latest standard blog posts.</li>
	<li>The post excerpts section will load your four latest standard posts (skipping posts already shown in the slider).</li>
	<li>The latest images section will load your latest image (post format) posts and display their thumbnails.</li>
	<li>The latest galleries section will load your latest gallery (post format) posts and display their thumbnails.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="help">Help and Support <small>(<a href="#toc">Table of Contents &uarr;</a>)</small></h2>

<p>
The Unique theme should be fairly straightforward in use. However, I recognize that some users require more help than others to get things up and running. For support, you should register at <a href="http://themehybrid.com">Theme Hybrid</a> to get the assistance you require.  We have over 30,000 people who use the forums and are a part of the community.  Theme support questions sent via email will be ignored.
</p>

<p>
If you find a legitimate bug with the theme, please do feel free to email me. I will see to it that the issue gets fixed right away. For all other requests, please use the theme's support forum.
