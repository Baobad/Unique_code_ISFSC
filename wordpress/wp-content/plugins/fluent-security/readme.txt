**ðŸš€ Two-Factor Authentication for Login**
Ensure secure access to your admin panel with Two-Factor Login via email for high-level user roles like Administrator / Editor. Even if a password gets compromised, only the right person will be able to log in with the additional authentication step.

**ðŸš€ Magic Login via Email**
Simplify the login process for end users like customers and subscribers. No more password resets or forgotten passwords that cause users to leave your site. With our improved flow and features, users can log in to your site simply by typing their username or email address and clicking on a secure one-time use link sent to their email.

**ðŸš€ Social Login / Register**
Allow users to log in to your site with their GitHub or Google accounts. This feature is lightweight and easy to enable.

**ðŸš€ Limit Login Attempts**
Protect your site against brute force attacks by blocking excessive login attempts. Our simple yet powerful tools also improve site security and performance, and allow for customizable lockout timings.

**ðŸš€ Dynamic Login Redirects**
Easily redirect users to specific pages after they log in or log out. Our drag-and-drop builder lets you customize the login and logout flow for different types of businesses.

**ðŸš€ Detailed Audit Logs**
Track exactly when users log in to your site and via which method (normal login form, magic URL, or social media) with our powerful audit logs.

**ðŸš€ Core Security Enhancement**
XML-RPC is a common target for WordPress attacks, but most sites don't actually need it. This plugin enables you to disable XML-RPC, Remote Application Login, and protect the wp-users listing for REST API for enhanced security.

**ðŸš€ Security Email Notifications**
As a business owner, it's important to know when high-level users like administrators, editors, and authors log in to your site, or if someone unauthorized is trying to log in. Our plugin includes email notifications to alert you of these events.

**ðŸš€ Super Fast Solution**
We've built this plugin to be super-fast and simple yet powerful, using the latest technologies like WordPress REST-API, VueJS V3, Vue-Router, and Element-Plus for UI building. We also use custom database tables to store audit logs, so they don't interfere with your default WordPress database tables.

**ðŸš€ Restrict /wp-admin for low level user roles**
If you want to restrict /wp-admin access for subscribers or other low level user roles then you can easily enable that and select the user roles that you want to restrict /wp-admin access.

== Why FluentAuth? ==

To improve the security and user experience of a WordPress website, the default authentication system may need to be enhanced with additional plugins. One common issue that WordPress site owners face is their site getting hacked. This is often due to hackers using brute-force attacks to guess passwords and gain access to the admin panel, leading to site takeover. Additionally, the use of common passwords on multiple sites can put all of them at risk if one password is compromised.

Using multiple security plugins can be detrimental to the performance of a WordPress website. These plugins, which are often bloated, intercept every WordPress request and run it through a large number of unnecessary rules, resulting in increased server resource usage and slower site performance. To avoid this issue, consider using a comprehensive security solution that offers multiple features in one package, instead of relying on multiple individual plugins. This will help save server resources and improve the overall performance of your website.

To Solve these issues, we decided to build FluentAuth and made it free.
